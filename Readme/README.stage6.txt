a) Reused Code:
  No

b) Complete:
  Stage 2 compelete

c) Portable:
Will your code always work if the proxy and the router were on different computers with different CPU architectures, like an IBM PowerPC and an AMD x86- 64? If so, why (what specifically did you do to support that case)? If not, why not (what problem would occur if run between different types of computers)? (Note that in your Project A, they are always on the same computer architecture because youâ€™re just forking another process, not connecting to another computer. This question is about the hypothetical case of if they were on different computers with different CPU architectures.)
